# SQL_Projects
Description: This repository contains various SQL projects and works that demonstrate my proficiency in SQL. Each project is contained within its own folder and includes SQL scripts, documentation, and sample data (if applicable). These projects showcase my ability to write complex SQL queries, create efficient database structures, and extract meaningful insights from data.

Projects included in this repository:

Customer Segmentation Analysis: A project that analyzes customer data to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
Sales Analysis Dashboard: A project that creates a dashboard to track sales metrics such as revenue, product sales, and customer acquisition.
